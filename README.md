# FrugalShopper
### In this project, simple Android app is built and created. 

> A frugal shopper at a grocery store likes to compare prices of items to be purchased. However, it is often
> the case that a few similar products are available, but they are offered in packages of different sizes and it
is difficult to decide if a package from brand X, which contains 1 pound 2 ounces of raisin bran at $5.99 is
a better buy than a package from brand Y for $3.49, that contains only 10 ounces of raisin bran. It would
be nice to enter quantities and prices for a few similar items into an app and have it quickly indicate which
product offers the lowest unit price, and thus is a better buy (not considering other factors, of course). A
frugal shopper would be able to make a quick, informed decision about which product to buy. Some
stores make this comparison already available, but many don’t. So, let’s create such an app. To make
things simpler, we will start with comparing only weights.
